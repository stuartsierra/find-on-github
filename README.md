# find-on-github

Functions in Emacs Lisp to determine a URL for a file & commit in a
GitHub.com repository and open it in a web browser.

This library was inspired by
[gleitz/browse-on-github.el](https://github.com/gleitz/browse-on-github.el)
but rewritten from scratch without an external script.


## Installation

Place the file `find-on-github.el` on your Emacs `load-path` and add
the following to your Emacs initialization file:

    (require 'find-on-github)



## Usage

While in a buffer viewing a file in a Git repository, call one of the
following:

    M-x browse-on-github

        Opens the current file, at the current commit, in the default
        web browser on GitHub.com.

    M-x find-on-github

        Displays a GitHub.com url for the current file, at the current
        commit, and copy it to the kill ring.

Both functions will create URLs that include the current line number
highlighted. If the region is active, they will show the lines in the
region highlighted. If point is at the beginning of the file, no lines
are highlighted.
